   INSTALLING extracellpy
 ___________________________


* SUMMARY:
  To use 'extracellpy' you need:
- Python (and a few Python modules) installed in your computer.
- Have the 'extracellpy' directory in your Python path.
- For loading Neuralynx data, you may need to compile modules in
  cLoadNeuralynx (see below).

  For the GUI-oriented we recommend the use of Spyder, a Python
  development environment similar to Matlab.
  http://packages.python.org/spyder/

  For the console-oriented we recommend IPython.
  http://ipython.org/


* DOWNLOADING THE PACKAGE:
  git clone git://github.com/sjara/extracellpy.git


* UBUNTU LINUX INSTALLATION:
- Install Python, numpy and matplotlib.
- Download and place 'extracellpy' in a directory of choice,
  for example ~/src/
- Add this directory to your Python path, by adding the following
  line to your ~/.bashrc :
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/src
- If modules for loading Neuralynx data are needed see instructions
  below on "COMPILING MODULE FOR LOADING DATA"


* WINDOWS INSTALLATION:
- We recommend the use of Spyder (which provides an interface similar
  to Matlab). This program is included in the pthonxy package.
- NOTE: Spyder is now distributed as a stand-alone program:
  http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/downloads/list
  But we haven't tested if it contains everything needed for extracellpy.
- When installing from pythonxy (www.pythonxy.com) include/exclude the
  following:
  EXCLUDE:
    VTK (jinja2?)
    Eclipse
    Others (all) 
  INCLUDE:
    Python 2.6.6 (by default)
    xy, xydoc, PyQt, spyder, formlayout, QtHelp, PyQwt, NumPy, SciPy,
    numexpr, guidata, guiqwt, matplotlib, gnuplot, PIL, IPython,
    Pyreadline, SetupTools, PyTables, vitables, h5py, Pywin32, py2exe,
    Sphinx, docutools, jinja2, pygments, ReportLab, nose, pylint 
- Extract extracellpy into c:\Python26\lib\site-packages\
- Copy extracellpy/cLoadNeuralynx/cLoadNeuralynx_WIN32.pyd to
  extracellpy/ and rename it to cLoadNeuralynx.pyd
- Make a copy of settings_EXAMPLE.py and call it settings.py
- Modify this file (settings.py) to reflect the paths for your data.


* MAC INSTALLATION:
- Download in a directory of choice. We will call it EXTRACELLPY_ROOT
- echo "export PYTHONPATH=~/src:\$PYTHONPATH" >> ~/.profile
sudo /usr/bin/easy_install numexpr
sudo /usr/bin/easy_install cython
- Install HDF5:
http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html
sudo /usr/bin/easy_install tables


* AFTER INSTALLING (all platforms):
- Make a copy of settings_EXAMPLE.py and name it settings.py
- Modify all relevant parameters in settings.py


* COMPILING MODULE FOR LOADING DATA:
  It requires Cython >0.14 which, if not in a package, can be installed with:
  sudo easy_install cython

= ON LINUX (32bit):
  cd ~/src/extracellpy/cLoadNeuralynx/
  make
- Or the individual steps:
  gcc -c -O2 -Wall loadNeuralynx.c
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
- This should create cLoadNeuralynx.so which should be copied to the
  'extracellpy' directory.

= ON LINUX (64bit):
- The first step must include the flag '-fPIC'
  gcc -c -O2 -Wall -fPIC loadNeuralynx.c
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace

= ON WINDOWS:
- You can use mingw32 (included in pythonxy) as compiler:
  gcc -c -O2 -Wall loadNeuralynx.c
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace --compiler=mingw32
- This should create cLoadNeuralynx.pyd which should be copied to the
  'extracellpy' directory.

= ON MAC:
- Apple's XCode includes gcc, so you can run:
  gcc -c -O2 -Wall loadNeuralynx.c
  (some warnings about '%d' will be corrected later)
  export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include
  python2.7 setup.py build_ext --inplace
